			<h3>Help</h3>
			<p class="paracv">On the left you are presented with buttons to view information about me and sections of my CV. If you look at the top right you will see a brick object sticking out, if you click it, it will hide and show the left section holding the buttons.<br><br>There should be 11 buttons on the left, if you can't see all 11 then scroll on the left section and they will appear. The same goes for the white background where the text appears. If you select multiple buttons or buttons with a lot of text and you can't see it then scroll and it will appear.</p>

			<h3>Code</h3>
			<p class="paracv">I'm currently studying a BSC in Cyber Security at Bath Spa University. So far in this degree I have skills in:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Developing professional websites (including this one).</li>
				<li>The programming languages: C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
				<li>Digital forensics.</li>
				<li>Penetration testing.</li>
				<li>The Computer Industry.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="paracv">Aside from my degree I have sufficient knowledge in IOS jailbreaking. IOS jailbreaking is a privilege escalation exploit executed to remove software restrictions (which is entirely legal), which is done through a series of kernal patches. This has given me sufficient knowledge in how the iPhone works inside and out.<br><br>Once this is done I then create the addons (tweaks), which require knowledge in the programming language Objective-C.<br><br>I have released a series of paid and free tweaks which has gained me experience in:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Business.</li>
				<li>Handling customers.</li>
				<li>How the iPhone works.</li>
				<li>Hard work always outweights talent.</li>
				<li>Dissembling and reassembling generations of iDevices.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div id="musicexpand">
			<h3>Music</h3>
			<p class="paracv">Besides from code I have skills in music, specifically the guitar which I have been playing for 12 years. I studied a two year Level 3 Extended Diploma in Music which I achieved three merits in. I learnt:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Songwriting & Composition.</li>
				<li>Music Theory.</li>
				<li>Stage Presence.</li>
				<li>How to perform on stage.</li>
				<li>How to perform in a band.</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="paracv">During Secondary School I studied Music as one of my GCSE's. I acheived a grade 7 in my music practical.</p>

			<p class="paracv">In 2021 I taught free guitar lessons to primary school children who had behavioural issues or couldn't fund paid guitar lessons. I didn't get paid for this as seeing a visible change in their life was a reward in itself.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="gymexpand">
			<h3>Gym</h3>
			<p class="paracv">My other activities and skill sets include the gym. I follow a strict three day training program which builds up my strength and provides me with muscle. This helps keep my mind in check and also disciplines me. The gym has become a strict part of my life and I can't see myself without it.<br><br>When I first started the gym I was very unhealthy and have seen significant progress since then. I have learnt:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Mind and body discipline.</li>
				<li>How the human body works mentally and physically.</li>
				<li>How to be and stay consistant.</li>
				<li>Reliability.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div id="gcseexpand">
			<h3>GCSEs</h3>
			<p class="paracv">I have 10 GCSE's ranging up to grade 7.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Maths</li>
				<li>English Literature</li>
				<li>English Language</li>
				<li>Biology</li>
				<li>Chemistry</li>
				<li>Physics</li>
				<li>Music</li>
				<li>Spanish</li>
				<li>History</li>
				<li>Physical Education</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="paracv">During secondary school, I went through a rough time and due to this I found it near to impossible to focus on my studies. After seeing my final grades and knowing the potential that I had, I was determined to show it, and I hopefully did that with my A-Levels.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="alevelexpand">
			<h3>A-Levels</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>3 Merits (Equivalent to three B's)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="paracv">I studied an all music course and in doing so hoped to re-gain the spark that I had for music. I was happy with my overall mark but also frustrated that it wasn't better. This mark was still levels above what I had achieved at during my GCSEs which proved that I could do it and also allowed me into Bath Spa University to study a BSC in Cyber Security.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="degreeexpand">
			<h3>Degrees</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>BSC in Cyber Security (In progress)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="paracv">I am currently studying a BSC in Cyber Security at Bath Spa University, a big jump from music. During the Covid-19 lockdown I decided to act on my life long interest in tech. I developed a passion for code and decided to do a Cyber Security degree instead of a Music degree. I figured I would have better opportunities in a more modern department. It's fair to say everything code related has become my life. I spend countless hours developing my skills each day and so far recieving a first on every code related project. But most importantly, I am enjoying it and so far has been a massive contrast to my GCSEs.</p>

			<h3>Music Academy</h3>
			<p class="paracv">During a week in 2020 I worked in a music academy for a week shadowing guitar lessons. I saw guitar lessons from a range of ages, children to adult. During this time I learnt many interesting skills: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Communication.</li>
				<li>Patience.</li>
				<li>Organisation.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Entrepreneurship</h3>
			<h3>What "Entrepreneurship" means to me</h3>
			<p class="paracv">Entrepreneurship to me is the freedom of doing, creating, and solving work. Being able to create my own business and make money from nothing but my skill set motivates me to do more. I only look up to my future self so I always have an end goal.</p>

			<h3>Jailbreaking business</h3>
			<p class="paracv">I started my own business, as I stated in the coding area of this page under my skills. Let me tell you a little bit more about it.<br><br>I've always enjoyed tinkering with things and customising toys, which evolved into repairing and modifying iPhones and other high-tech devices. I was lucky enough to be able to get my hands on an Apple Macbook Pro during the first Covid-19 lockdown, which allowed me to write code and progress. Instead of using the jailbreak features I wanted to create them myself. But I had no experience with programming languages.<br><br> As a result, I began with the basics. I investigated IOS theming, which required solely design abilities. After then, I released a number of free and paid iOS themes. Although this was insufficient to me. The next step was to investigate creating 'tweaks' which necessitated knowledge of the Objective-C programming language. I then produced a series of commercial and free IOS modifications over the next year, each one expanding my expertise of coding and 'tweaks'. This was a gentle but harsh introduction to the world of coding. I established a small business and a website, gaining a following and a reputation as a developer. This taught me a lot of life lessons and skills, the majority of which are listed in the code section under my skills.</p>

			<h3>Website business</h3>
			<p class="paracv">As of today I have created 4 interactive, professional websites for people. Seeing as I am just starting this business out I am yet to create a website and start adversiting, but by creating free and professional websites for people they can be good references for me for potential clients and can also see examples of my work. See below for examples of my work:</p>

			<h3>Free guitar lessons</h3>
			<p class="paracv">In 2021, I volunteered to teach free guitar lessons to primary school pupils who could not afford it. These children often had behavioural issues or were brought up in a household who didn't support them. I didn't charge for the lessons because witnessing a visible shift in their attitude and life in general was rewarding enough. Teaching the children my knowledge taught them not just how to channel their anger into physical objects and things they enjoyed, but it also taught me how to teach and learn. </p>

		<div id="personalstatementexpand">
			<h3>Personal Statement</h3>
			<p class="paracv">
				I once read that the best way to make money is whilst you sleep, so I tried it. I started my own coding/cyber security business which subsequently evolved from creating, specialising, and studying music for 14 years of my life. I created pieces of code that I then sold to interested clients online. As my code got better, I started to develop a following and reputation. I speak more about this in the sections above. The music industry is becoming increasingly harder to make it in so a coding and Cyber Security path I felt was a much more practical path for my life. Whilst the music industry is harder in success rate, the Cyber industry is more accessible. I have comfortably achieved all firsts in every one of my coding projects including C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which has ensured me with my Cyber Security course choice.<br><br>In regards to the future I have aspirations to work for a big firm protecting them against Cyber threats or to create websites or help code their projects. Eventually after gaining knowledge and first hand, high end experiences, I want to own my own corporation.</p>
