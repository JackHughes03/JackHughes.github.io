	<h3 class="h3title">Jailbreaking:</h3>
	<p class="aboutmep">According to <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-jailbreaking">KasperSky:</a></p>
	<blockquote id="quote">"Jailbreaking allows the device owner to gain full access to the root of the operating system and access all the features."</blockquote>

	<p class="aboutmep">I came across jailbreaking and jailbroke my first device (iPod touch 4th gen). From then on I've just been solififying and expanding my knowledge of iPhones and computers in general. Not only has jailbreak increased my knowledge of the digital world, but I gained knowledge in how the iPhone works, in and out, which has been really interesting.<br><br>In 2019 during the first lockdown<span id="readmore">...</span><span id="more">, I started to get tired of just using the jailbreak and addons that come with it so I decided to look into icon creating.<br><br>The first time I deployed my own 'theme' onto my iDevice I was rushed with excitement. Although this wasn't enough for me, I wanted to be able to code the more advanced features, I wanted a challenge.<br><br>I then looked into creating the 'addons', also known as 'tweaks' and realised that they required Objective-C code. During the next year or so, I released a series paid and free 'tweaks' in a developer name. Although my Objective-C still isn't great, I learnt so many important lessons.<br><br>Hopefully in the future I can use this knowledge and do work higher up than jailbreaking.</span><button onclick="myFunction()" id="but">Read more</button></p>
