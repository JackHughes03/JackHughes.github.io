<h2 class="codeh2">C++:</h2>
<ul class="codeul">
	<li>C++ is a language that I have efficient knowledge in.</li><br>
	<li>I know key components of the language and have been taught it by my univeristy lecturer along side self teaching.</li><br>
	<li>Hopefully in the future I can develop my understading of C++ and use the language for more complex operations instead of programs.</li><br>
</ul>

<h2 class="codeh2">HTML/5:</h2>
<ul class="codeul">
	<li>HTML/5 is a language that I have dabbled in since the first COVID-19 lockdown.</li><br>
	<li>I am highly confident in this language and love it to bits. Probably my favourite language so far.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="codeh2">CSS:</h2>
<ul class="codeul">
	<li>Along side teaching myself HTML/5 I taught myself CSS to help style my websites.</li><br>
	<li>As I became more fluent in it, I started writing more complex websites for myself and others.</li><br>
</ul>

<h2 class="codeh2">JavaScript:</h2>
<ul class="codeul">
	<li>JavaScript is a language that I have learnt through my HTML/5 course at University.</li><br>
	<li>My understanding of this language is improving everyday!</li><br>
</ul>

<h2 class="codeh2">Objective-C:</h2>
<ul class="codeul">
	<li>Currently my Objective-C is not the best. I know small portions of code that contribute to wider projects.</li><br>
	<li>I mainly use it to create tweaks in IOS jailbreaking although I do not know the full structure of the language.</li><br>
	<li>Obj-C was the first language I taught myself so in the process I did not teach myself it correctly. I do plan on teaching myself this language correctly in the near future.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="codeh2">Shell (Bash):</h2>
<ul class="codeul">
	<li>This command language is another one I taught myself.</li><br>
	<li>I am not the greatest at it but I enjoy making little bash scripts that execute commands quickly.</li><br>
</ul>
