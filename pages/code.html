	<p id="sim">C++, HTML/5, CSS, Obj-c, JavaScript, Python, Shell (Bash)</p>
	<hr>

	<h2 class="codeh2">C++</h2>
	<ul class="codeul">
		<li>C++ is a language that I have efficient knowledge in.</li><br>
		<li>I know key components of the language and have been taught it by my univeristy lecturer along side self teaching.</li><br>
		<li>Hopefully in the future I can develop my understading of C++ and use the language for more complex operations instead of simple programs.</li><br>
	</ul>

	<h2 class="codeh2">Obj-C</h2>
	<ul class="codeul">
		<li>Currently my Objective-C is not the best. I know small portions of code that contribute to wider projects.</li><br>
		<li>I mainly use it to create tweaks in IOS jailbreaking although I do not know the structure of the language.</li><br>
		<li>Obj-C was the first language I taught myself so in the process I did not teach myself it correctly. I do plan on teaching myself this language correctly very shortly.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 class="codeh2">HTML/5</h2>
	<ul class="codeul">
		<li>HTML/5 is a language that I have dabbled in since the first COVID-19 lockdown.</li>
		<li>Ititially when teaching myself HTML/5 I did the same thing as Obj-C, I did not teach myself correctly. This lead to bad practices and code.</li>
		<li>Fast forward to 2022 and I decided to re teach my self the language ahead of the HTML/5 & CSS course I was about to start for University.</li>
		<li>I am highly confident in this language and love it to bits. Probably my favourite language so far.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 class="codeh2">CSS</h2>
	<ul class="codeul">
		<li>Along side teaching myself HTML/5 I taught myself CSS to help style my websites.</li>
		<li>As I became more fluent in it, I started writing more complex websites for myseld and others.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 class="codeh2">Shell (Bash)</h2>
	<ul class="codeul">
		<li>This command language is another one I taught myself.</li>
		<li>I am not the greatest at it but I enjoy making little bash scripts that execute something quickly.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 class="codeh2">JavaScript</h2>
	<ul class="codeul">
		<li>Na.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 class="codeh2">Python</h2>
	<ul class="codeul">
		<li>Na.</li>
