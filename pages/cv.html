			<h3>Code</h3>
			<p class="paracv">Currently studying a BSC in Cyber Security at Bath Spa University. So far in this degree I have skills in:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Developing professional websites (including this one).</li>
				<li>The programming languages: C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
				<li>Digital forensics.</li>
				<li>Penetration testing.</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="paracv">Aside from my degree I have sufficient knowledge in IOS jailbreaking. IOS jailbreaking is a privilege escalation exploit executed to remove software restrictions (which is entirely legal), which is done through a series of kernal patches. This has given me sufficient knowledge in how the iPhone works inside and out.<br><br>Once this is done I then create the addons (tweaks), which require knowledge in the programming language Objective-C.<br><br>I have released a series of paid and free tweaks which has gained me experience in:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Business.</li>
				<li>Handling customers.</li>
				<li>How the iPhone works.</li>
				<li>Hard work always outweights talent.</li>
				<li>Dissembling and reassembling generations of iDevices.</li>
			</ul>

		<div id="musicexpand">
			<h3>Music</h3>
			<p class="paracv">Asides from code I have skills in music, specifically the guitar (which I have been playing for 12 years). I studied a two year Level 3 Extended Diploma in Music, (which I achieved three merits in. I learnt:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Songwriting & Composition.</li>
				<li>Music Theory.</li>
				<li>Stage Presence.</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="paracv">In 2021 I taught free guitar lessons to primary school children who had behavioural issues or couldn't fund paid guitar lessons. I didn't get paid for this as seeing a visible change in their life was a reward in itself.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="gymexpand">
			<h3>Gym</h3>
			<p class="paracv">My other activities and skill sets include the gym. I follow a strict three day training program which builds up my strength and provides me with muscle. This helps keep my mind in check and also disciplins me.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Mind and body discipline.</li>
				<li>How the human body works mentally and physically.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<div id="gcseexpand">
			<h3>GCSEs</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Maths: 5</li>
				<li>English: 5</li>
				<li>Combined triple Science: 3</li>
				<li>Music practical: 7</li>
				<li>Music technical: 4</li>
				<li>Spanish: 4</li>
				<li>History: 3</li>
				<li>Physical Education: 3</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="paracv">During secondary school, I went through a rough time and due to this I found it near to impossible to focus on my studies. After seeing my final grades and knowing the potential that I had, I was determined to show it, and I hopefully did that with my A-Levels.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="alevelexpand">
			<h3>A-Levels</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>3 Merits (Equivalent to three B's)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="paracv">I studied an all music course and in doing so hoped to re-gain the spark that I had for music. I was happy with my overall mark but also fusrtated that it wasn't better. This mark was still levels above what I had achieved at during my GCSEs which proved that I could do it and also allowed me into Bath Spa University to study a BSC in Cyber Security.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="degreeexpand">
			<h3>Degrees</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>BSC in Cyber Security (In progress)</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="paracv">Currently studying a BSC in Cyber Security at Bath Spa University. A big jump from music hey? Anyways, during the Covid-19 lockdown I decided to act on my life long interest in tech. I developed a passion for code and decided to do a Cyber Security degree instead of a Music degree. I figured I would have better opportunities in a more modern department aswell. It's fair to say everything code related has become my life. I spend countless hours developing my skills each day and so far recieving a first on every code related project.</p>

		<div id="musicacademyexpand">
			<h3>Music Academy</h3>
			<p class="paracv">During a week in 2020 I worked in a music academy for a week shadowing guitar lessons. I saw guitar lessons from a range of ages, children to adult. During this time I learnt many interesting skills: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Communication</li>
				<li>Patience</li>
				<li>Organisation</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Entrepreneurship</h3>
			<p class="paracv">I started my own business, as I stated in the coding area of this page under my skills. Let me tell you a little bit more about it. I've always enjoyed tinkering with things and customising toys, which evolved into repairing iPhones and other high-tech devices. I was able to get my hands on an Apple Macbook Pro during the first Covid-19 lockdown, which allowed me to write code and progress. Instead of using the jailbreak features I wanted to create them myself. But I had no experience with programming languages... As a result, I began with the basics. I investigated IOS theming, which required solely design abilities. After then, I released a number of free and paid iOS themes. Although this was insufficient, so the next step was to investigate creating 'tweaks' which necessitated knowledge of the Objective-C programming language. I produced a series of commercial and free IOS modifications over the next year, each one expanding my expertise of coding and 'tweaks'. This was a gentle but harsh introduction to the world of coding. I established a small business and a website, gaining a following and a reputation as a developer. This taught me a lot of life lessons and skills, the majority of which are listed in the code section above.</p>

			<h3>Free guitar lessons</h3>
			<p class="paracv">In 2021, I volunteered to teach free guitar lessons to primary school pupils who could not afford it. These children often had behavioural issues or were brought up in a household who didn't support them. I didn't charge for the lessons because witnessing a visible shift in their attitude and life in general was rewarding enough. Teaching the children my knowledge taught them not just how to channel their anger into physical objects and things they enjoyed, but it also taught me how to teach and learn. </p>
